An image recognition system for vegetables and fruits

## Problem Statement:
The image recognition system for vegetables and fruits proposed in this application is motivated by the practical application for check-out stations used in grocery stores. The system will help the customers in identifying the vegetables or fruits in the image taken and display the quality and calorific value of that produce.

## Solution:
The application has three major modules.

### 1. UI - Android Mobile app to capture images and add items for shopping


### 2. CNN Model to identify and recognize the items in the image.

### 3. Texture feature extraction to detect the quality of the item.

## Results:
We Developed a mobile app to capture images using the integrated mobile's camera and successfully achieved below goals:
1. Detect the vegetable/ fruit present in the image
2. Classify the quality of the item detected as good or bad
3. Fetch the Nutrition details of the item detected
4. Provide option to add the item to cart for shopping
